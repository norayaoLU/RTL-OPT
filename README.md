# RTL-OPT: A Benchmark for RTL Code Optimization

**RTL-OPT** is a benchmark designed to evaluate RTL code optimization for improving IC design quality. The dataset consists of 40 digital IC designs, each containing suboptimal and expert-optimized RTL code, enabling the assessment of LLM-generated RTL code. The dataset also includes an integrated evaluation framework for automatic verification of functional correctness and quantification of PPA (Power, Performance, Area) improvements.

This benchmark provides a realistic and comprehensive evaluation method for generative AI models in hardware design optimization.

## Dataset Contents

- **Number of Designs**: 36 digital IC designs
- **Code Types**:
  - Suboptimal RTL code
  - Expert-optimized RTL code (golden reference)
